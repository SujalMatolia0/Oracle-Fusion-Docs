title: Standard Objects Overview
description: Overview of Standard Objects in Oracle Fusion Application Composer
---

<br></br>

The **Standard Objects** module in Application Composer provides **predefined business objects** delivered by Oracle as part of Oracle Fusion Sales and Service Cloud.

These objects represent **core CRM entities** and are used by most organizations without the need to create custom structures.

---

## What are Standard Objects?

**Standard Objects** are business entities that are:

- Delivered and maintained by Oracle
- Designed to support common CRM processes
- Available immediately when the application is provisioned

You can think of standard objects as **built-in tables** provided by Oracle.

---

## Examples of Standard Objects

Common standard objects include:

- Account
- Contact
- Opportunity
- Lead
- Service Request
- Activity

These objects are tightly integrated with Oracle Fusion functionality.

---

## How Standard Objects Are Used

Standard objects are used to:

- Manage core customer and sales data
- Support out-of-the-box CRM workflows
- Enable reporting and analytics
- Integrate with other Oracle Fusion modules

Most standard business processes depend on standard objects.

---

## What Can Be Configured on Standard Objects

Although standard objects cannot be fully modified, they **can be configured**.

You can configure:

- Custom fields
- Page layouts
- Relationships (within limits)
- Validation rules
- Triggers and object logic
- Security and access control

All configurations are **upgrade-safe**.

---

## What Cannot Be Changed

Standard objects have controlled limitations.

You **cannot**:

- Delete standard objects
- Remove Oracle-delivered fields
- Change core object structure
- Modify underlying database schema

Oracle controls the base definition of standard objects.

---

## Business Logic on Standard Objects

Standard objects support server-side logic.

### Validation Rules
- Validate data before saving
- Applied at field or object level

### Triggers
- Execute logic on create, update, or delete
- Used for automation

### Object Functions
- Reusable Groovy logic
- Executed based on business conditions

---

## Relationships in Standard Objects

- Standard objects already have predefined relationships
- Additional relationships can be created within allowed limits
- Used for navigation, reporting, and data consistency

---

## Security on Standard Objects

Security is managed using:

- Roles
- Privileges
- Object-level and field-level access

> **Note on Security Differences**
>
> Security behavior for **Standard Objects** is more restricted compared to **Custom Objects**.
>
> - Standard Objects use **Oracle-defined roles and privileges**
> - Core security rules cannot be removed or overridden
> - Field-level and object-level access is limited to supported configurations
>
> In contrast, **Custom Objects** provide greater flexibility in defining security, roles, and access control.
>
> This ensures that Oracle-delivered business processes remain stable and upgrade-safe.


---

## Important Characteristics of Standard Objects

- Maintained by Oracle
- Automatically upgraded
- Integrated with other Fusion modules
- Use Oracle-defined identifiers (such as Party ID in CRM)

---

## When to Use Standard Objects

Standard objects should be used when:

- Business requirements match Oracle-delivered functionality
- Standard CRM processes are sufficient
- Long-term upgrade compatibility is critical

Custom objects should be used **only when required**.

---

## Summary

The Standard Objects module in Application Composer allows users to:

- Use Oracle-delivered business entities
- Configure behavior without changing core structure
- Apply business logic and security
- Maintain upgrade safety and system integrity

Standard objects form the backbone of Oracle Fusion Sales and Service Cloud.
