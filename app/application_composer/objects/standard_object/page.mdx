# Standard Objects Overview

The **Standard Objects** module in Application Composer provides **predefined business objects** delivered by Oracle as part of Oracle Fusion Sales and Service Cloud.

These objects represent **core CRM entities** and are used by most organizations without the need to create custom structures.

---

## What are Standard Objects?

**Standard Objects** are business entities that are:

- Delivered and maintained by Oracle
- Designed to support common CRM processes
- Available immediately when the application is provisioned

You can think of standard objects as **built-in tables** provided by Oracle.

<Callout>
Standard objects are the foundation of Oracle Fusion CRM and come pre-configured with fields, relationships, and business logic to support industry-standard processes.
</Callout>

## What Can Be Configured on Standard Objects

Although standard objects cannot be fully modified, they **can be configured** to meet specific business needs.

### Configurable Elements

| Configuration Type | Description | Example |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Custom Fields** | Add organization-specific attributes | Industry Type, Customer Segment |
| **Page Layouts** | Customize UI forms and views | Reorder fields, add sections |
| **Relationships** | Create new connections (within limits) | Link to custom objects |
| **Validation Rules** | Enforce data quality | Required field combinations |
| **Triggers** | Automate business logic | Auto-populate fields on save |
| **Object Functions** | Reusable Groovy logic | Calculate discount percentages |
| **Security** | Control access and visibility | Role-based field access |

<Callout>
All configurations are **upgrade-safe** and designed to survive Oracle's quarterly updates without breaking.
</Callout>

### Configuration Best Practices

- Use custom fields for organization-specific data
- Keep page layouts simple and user-friendly
- Test configurations in sandbox before production deployment
- Document all customizations for future reference
- Avoid excessive complexity in triggers and validations

---

## What Cannot Be Changed

Standard objects have controlled limitations to ensure system stability.

### Restrictions

| Restriction | Reason | Alternative |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Delete Standard Objects** | Core to CRM functionality | Hide from UI if not needed |
| **Remove Oracle-Delivered Fields** | Required for system operations | Hide fields instead |
| **Change Core Object Structure** | Ensures upgrade compatibility | Use custom objects for unique needs |
| **Modify Database Schema** | Managed by Oracle | Use APIs for data access |
| **Alter Base Relationships** | Maintains data integrity | Add supplementary relationships |

<Callout type="warning">
Oracle controls the base definition of standard objects. Attempting to work around these restrictions can cause system instability and upgrade failures.
</Callout>

---

## Business Logic on Standard Objects

Standard objects support server-side logic to enforce business rules and automate processes.

### Validation Rules

Ensure data quality before records are saved.

| Validation Type | Scope | Example |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| **Field-Level** | Single field | Email format validation |
| **Object-Level** | Multiple fields | Ensure close date is after create date |
| **Cross-Object** | Related objects | Verify account status before creating opportunity |

### Triggers

Execute logic automatically during record lifecycle events.

| Trigger Event | Common Use Cases |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Before Create** | Set default values, assign territories |
| **After Create** | Create related records, send notifications |
| **Before Update** | Validate changes, check permissions |
| **After Update** | Update rollup fields, sync with external systems |
| **Before Delete** | Prevent deletion of critical records |
| **After Delete** | Archive data, clean up relationships |

### Object Functions

Reusable Groovy methods for common calculations and operations.

```groovy
// Example: Calculate opportunity probability based on stage
def calculateProbability(stage) {
    def probabilityMap = [
        'Qualification': 10,
        'Needs Analysis': 25,
        'Proposal': 50,
        'Negotiation': 75,
        'Closed Won': 100
    ]
    return probabilityMap[stage] ?: 0
}
```

<Callout type="info">
Server-side logic runs on Oracle's infrastructure, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of access method (UI, API, mobile).
</Callout>

---

## Relationships in Standard Objects

Standard objects come with predefined relationships that support core CRM processes.

### Pre-Configured Relationships

| Parent Object | Child Object | Relationship Type | Purpose |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Account | Contact | One-to-Many | People at companies |
| Account | Opportunity | One-to-Many | Sales deals for accounts |
| Opportunity | Product | Many-to-Many | Products in opportunities |
| Account | Service Request | One-to-Many | Customer support issues |
| Contact | Activity | One-to-Many | Tasks and meetings |

### Adding Custom Relationships

You can create additional relationships within allowed limits:

- Link standard objects to custom objects
- Create lookup fields to other standard objects
- Define parent-child relationships (where supported)

**Relationships are used for**:
- Navigation between related records
- Reporting and analytics across objects
- Data consistency and integrity
- Business process automation

---

## Security on Standard Objects

Security controls who can access and modify data in standard objects.

### Security Layers

| Security Level | Description | Configuration |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Object Security** | Access to entire object | Managed through roles and privileges |
| **Field Security** | Read/write permissions on fields | Configure in Application Composer |
| **Record Security** | Which records users can see | Territory-based, owner-based, or custom rules |
| **Action Security** | Who can perform specific operations | Create, update, delete permissions |

### Security Differences: Standard vs Custom Objects

<Callout type="warning">
Security behavior for **Standard Objects** is more restricted compared to **Custom Objects**.
</Callout>

| Aspect | Standard Objects | Custom Objects |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Base Security** | Oracle-defined, cannot be removed | Fully customizable |
| **Roles & Privileges** | Use Oracle-delivered roles | Define custom roles |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to supported configurations | Greater control over access rules |
| **Override Capability** | Core rules cannot be overridden | Complete control within platform limits |

**Why This Matters**:
- Ensures Oracle-delivered business processes remain stable
- Maintains upgrade safety and system integrity
- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

## Important Characteristics of Standard Objects

Understanding these characteristics helps with effective configuration and troubleshooting.

| Characteristic | Description | Impact |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Oracle Maintenance** | Maintained and updated by Oracle | Automatic improvements and fixes |
| **Automatic Upgrades** | Enhanced with quarterly updates | New features without custom development |
| **Module Integration** | Pre-integrated with Fusion modules | Seamless data flow across applications |
| **Oracle Identifiers** | Use system-defined IDs (e.g., Party ID) | Integration complexity consideration |
| **Backwards Compatibility** | Changes maintain compatibility | Customizations remain functional |

### Understanding Party ID

In Oracle CRM objects, **Party ID** is used instead of simple record IDs:

- Party model represents persons and organizations
- Enables complex relationship modeling
- Required for Oracle's Trading Community Architecture (TCA)
- Important consideration for integrations and reporting

## When to Use Standard Objects

### Use Standard Objects When:

| Scenario | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Requirements Match Oracle Functionality** | Avoid unnecessary customization |
| **Standard CRM Processes Sufficient** | Leverage best practices built-in |
| **Upgrade Compatibility Critical** | Minimize customization risk |
| **Integration with Fusion Modules** | Pre-built connections available |
| **Rapid Implementation Needed** | Faster deployment with standard objects |

### Use Custom Objects When:

| Scenario | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Unique Data Model Required** | Standard objects don't fit business needs |
| **Industry-Specific Requirements** | Specialized tracking needed |
| **Complete Control Needed** | Full flexibility in design |
| **Isolated Functionality** | No connection to core CRM processes |

<Callout>
**Best Practice**: Always start with standard objects and extend them with custom fields. Create custom objects only when standard objects truly cannot meet your requirements.
</Callout>
