title: Custom Objects Overview
description: Overview of Custom Objects in Oracle Fusion Application Composer
---

<br></br>

The **Custom Objects** module in Application Composer allows users to **create and manage custom business entities** when standard Oracle objects do not meet business requirements.

Custom objects are fully configurable and are commonly used to store **organization-specific data**.

---

## What is a Custom Object?

A **Custom Object** is a user-defined business entity created using Application Composer.

You can think of a custom object as:
- A custom database table
- A business entity with UI, security, and logic

Custom objects are created and managed **entirely through the UI**, without direct database access.

---

## When to Use Custom Objects

Custom objects are used when:

- Required data does not fit into standard objects
- Business processes are unique
- Additional tracking or reporting is needed
- Extensions must remain upgrade-safe

---

## Core Components of a Custom Object

Each custom object can include the following components.

---

### Fields

- Fields are attributes of a custom object
- Similar to columns in a database table
- Can be standard or custom
- Used to store business data

---

### Pages

- Pages control how users interact with object data
- Define create, edit, and view layouts
- UI behavior is managed through Application Composer and Page Composer

---

### Links and Actions

- **Links** are used for navigation between pages or objects
- **Actions** perform operations on records
- Actions can trigger business logic

---

### Security

- Security controls access to custom object data
- Based on roles and privileges
- Determines who can view, create, update, or delete records

---

## Relationships in Custom Objects

Custom objects can be connected to other objects using relationships.

- Parent–child relationships are supported
- Used to link related business data
- Important for navigation, reporting, and data integrity

---

## Server-Side Business Logic

Custom objects support server-side logic using Groovy scripts.

---

### Validation Rules

- Applied at field or object level
- Validate data before saving
- Prevent incorrect or incomplete data entry

---

### Triggers

- Executed during create, update, or delete events
- Used for automation and conditional logic
- Can react to field value changes

---

### Object Functions

- Custom Groovy methods defined on objects
- Used for reusable business logic
- Can be called from triggers or actions

---

## Web Services for Custom Objects

Custom objects can be exposed using **Web Services**.

### SOAP Web Services
- XML-based
- Used in enterprise integrations

### REST Web Services
- HTTP-based (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Require request and response payloads

These services allow external systems to interact with custom object data.

---

## Important Limitations and Behavior

- Custom objects **cannot be permanently deleted**
- Records are usually **soft-deleted** by Oracle
- In CRM objects, Oracle often uses **Party ID** instead of simple record IDs
- Direct database access is not allowed
- All changes must remain upgrade-safe

---

## Why Custom Objects Are Important

Custom objects help organizations:

- Extend CRM functionality safely
- Store business-specific data
- Implement custom workflows
- Maintain Oracle upgrade compatibility

---

## Summary

The Custom Objects module in Application Composer allows users to:

- Create custom business entities
- Configure fields, pages, and relationships
- Apply validation rules and triggers
- Secure data using roles
- Integrate with external systems

Custom objects provide flexibility while maintaining Oracle Fusion best practices.
