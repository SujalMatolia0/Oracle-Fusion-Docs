# Objects Overview

The **Objects** module in Application Composer is used to **define and manage business data** in Oracle Fusion Sales and Service Cloud.

Objects represent **real business entities** such as customers, service requests, or transactions and form the foundation of configuration and customization.

---

## What is an Object?

An **Object** in Oracle Fusion is a structured container used to store business information.

You can think of an object as:
- A database table
- A business entity in the application

Every object can include data, UI configuration, security, and business logic.

---

## Types of Objects

Application Composer supports two types of objects.

### Standard Objects

Pre-built objects delivered by Oracle for core business processes.

| Characteristic | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **Source** | Delivered by Oracle |
| **Use Case** | Core business processes |
| **Customization** | Can be configured but not deleted |
| **Examples** | Account, Contact, Opportunity, Service Request |

### Custom Objects

User-created objects for specific business requirements.

| Characteristic | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **Source** | Created by customers |
| **Use Case** | When standard objects are insufficient |
| **Customization** | Fully configurable within Oracle limits |
| **Features** | Support fields, pages, relationships, security, and scripts |

<Callout>
**Note**: Custom objects follow the same structure as standard objects but are tailored to your specific business needs.
</Callout>

---

## Object Components

Each object consists of multiple components that define its structure and behavior.

### Fields

Store individual data values within an object.

- Similar to table columns
- Can be standard or custom
- Support various data types (text, number, date, picklist, etc.)

### Records

Individual rows of data representing actual business entries.

- Each record is a unique instance
- Contains field values
- Managed through UI or APIs

### Pages

Control how data is displayed to users.

| Page Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Create Page** | Form for creating new records |
| **View Page** | Display record details |
| **Edit Page** | Modify existing records |
| **List Page** | Show multiple records in a table |

### Links and Actions

Navigation and operations within the application.

- **Links**: Allow navigation between pages and related records
- **Actions**: Perform operations such as save, update, delete, or execute custom logic

### Security

Controls access to objects and their data.

| Security Level | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Object Level** | Controls who can access the object |
| **Field Level** | Controls read/write permissions on specific fields |
| **Record Level** | Controls which records users can see |

All security is based on roles and privileges.

---

## Object Relationships

### Child Objects

Objects can have **child objects** to store related data.

- Used for one-to-many relationships
- Example: Order (parent) → Order Items (child)
- One parent can have many child records

```
Order
├── Order Item 1
├── Order Item 2
└── Order Item 3
```

### Relationship Types

Define how objects are connected to each other.

| Relationship Type | Description | Example |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **One-to-One** | Single record relates to single record | User → User Profile |
| **One-to-Many** | Single record relates to multiple records | Account → Contacts |
| **Many-to-Many** | Multiple records relate to multiple records | Projects → Resources |

**Relationships are used for**:
- Data linking between objects
- Navigation across related records
- Reporting and analytics
- Maintaining data consistency

</Callout>

### Rollup Fields

A **Rollup Field** is a calculated field on a parent object that summarizes data from child objects.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Aggregate data from child records |
| **Location** | Defined on parent object |
| **Update** | Automatically recalculated when child data changes |
| **Common Uses** | Totals, counts, averages, min/max values |

**Example**:
```
Order (Parent)
  - Total Amount (Rollup Field)
  
Order Items (Children)
  - Item 1: $100
  - Item 2: $200
  - Item 3: $150
  
Total Amount = $450 (automatically calculated)
```

---

## Business Logic on Objects

Objects can include **server-side business logic** to enforce rules and automate processes.

### Validation Rules

Ensure data quality before records are saved.

- Applied at field or object level
- Prevent incorrect or incomplete data
- Display error messages to users
- Execute before save operations

**Example Use Cases**:
- Ensure email format is valid
- Check that required fields are filled
- Verify that discount percentage is within limits

### Triggers

Execute logic automatically during record lifecycle events.

| Trigger Type | When It Runs | Use Case |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Before Create** | Before a new record is saved | Set default values |
| **After Create** | After a new record is created | Send notifications |
| **Before Update** | Before changes are saved | Validate changes |
| **After Update** | After changes are saved | Update related records |
| **Before Delete** | Before record is deleted | Check dependencies |
| **After Delete** | After record is deleted | Clean up related data |

### Object Functions

Custom Groovy methods defined on objects for reusable logic.

```groovy
// Example: Object function to calculate tax
def calculateTax(amount) {
    def taxRate = 0.08
    return amount * taxRate
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- Reusable across multiple triggers and validations
- Execute based on conditions
- Improve code maintainability

<Callout type="warning">
All object logic runs on the **server**, not in the browser. This ensures data security and consistency.
</Callout>

## Web Services on Objects

Objects can be exposed through **Web Services** to enable integration with external systems.

### SOAP Web Services

XML-based web services for enterprise integrations.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Protocol** | SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) |
| **Format** | XML |
| **Use Case** | Legacy enterprise integrations |
| **Operations** | Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) |

### REST Web Services

HTTP-based web services using standard HTTP methods.

| HTTP Method | Operation | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **GET** | Read | Retrieve records |
| **POST** | Create | Create new records |
| **PUT** | Update | Update existing records |
| **PATCH** | Partial Update | Update specific fields |
| **DELETE** | Delete | Remove records |

**Characteristics**:
- Lightweight and modern
- Uses JSON for request/response
- Easier to consume than SOAP
- Better for web and mobile applications

## Why Objects Are Important

Objects are the foundation of Oracle Fusion applications because they:

| Capability | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Store business data** | Central repository for all information |
| **Drive UI behavior** | Determine what users see and can do |
| **Control automation** | Enable validations and workflows |
| **Enforce security** | Protect sensitive data |
| **Enable integrations** | Connect with external systems |

<Callout>
Almost every feature in Sales and Service Cloud depends on objects. Understanding objects is essential for effective customization.
</Callout>

## Summary

The Objects module in Application Composer is used to:

- Define standard and custom objects
- Store and manage business data
- Create relationships and rollup fields
- Apply validations, triggers, and functions
