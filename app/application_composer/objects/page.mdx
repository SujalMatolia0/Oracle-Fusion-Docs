title: Objects Overview
description: Overview of Objects in Oracle Fusion Application Composer
---

<br></br>

The **Objects** module in Application Composer is used to **define and manage business data** in Oracle Fusion Sales and Service Cloud.

Objects represent **real business entities** such as customers, service requests, or transactions and form the foundation of configuration and customization.

---

## What is an Object?

An **Object** in Oracle Fusion is a structured container used to store business information.

You can think of an object as:
- A database table
- A business entity in the application

Every object can include data, UI configuration, security, and business logic.

---

## Types of Objects

Application Composer supports two types of objects.

### Standard Objects
- Delivered by Oracle
- Used for core business processes
- Can be configured but not fully changed or deleted
- Examples: Account, Contact, Opportunity, Service Request

### Custom Objects
- Created by customers
- Used when standard objects are not sufficient
- Fully configurable within Oracle limits
- Support fields, pages, relationships, security, and scripts

---

## Object Components

Each object can contain the following components.

### Fields
- Store individual data values
- Similar to table columns
- Can be standard or custom

### Records
- Individual rows of data
- Represent actual business entries

### Pages
- Control how data is shown to users
- Define create, view, and edit layouts

### Links and Actions
- **Links** allow navigation between pages
- **Actions** perform operations such as save, update, or execute logic

### Security
- Controls access to objects and fields
- Based on roles and privileges

---

## Object Creation Concepts

### Child Objects
- Objects can have **child objects**
- Used to store related data
- Example: Order → Order Items
- One parent can have many child records

---

### Relationships Between Objects

Relationships define how objects are connected.

Supported relationship types include:
- **One-to-One**
- **One-to-Many**
- **Many-to-Many**

Relationships are used for:
- Data linking
- Navigation
- Reporting
- Maintaining data consistency

---

### Rollup Fields

A **Rollup Field** is a calculated field on a **parent object**.

- It summarizes data from child objects
- Example: Total Amount from Order Items
- Automatically updates based on child records

Rollup fields are commonly used for totals, counts, and summaries.

---

## Business Logic on Objects

Objects can include **server-side business logic**.

### Validation Rules
- Validate data before saving
- Can be applied at field or object level
- Prevent incorrect or incomplete data

---

### Triggers
- Execute logic during create, update, or delete events
- Used for automation and conditional behavior
- Can run when field values change

---

### Object Functions
- Custom Groovy methods defined on objects
- Used when logic needs to be reused
- Executed based on conditions

All object logic runs on the **server**.

---

## Web Services on Objects

Objects can be exposed through **Web Services** for integration.

### SOAP Web Services
- XML-based
- Used in enterprise integrations

### REST Web Services
- HTTP-based
- Uses methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Requires request and response payloads

Web services allow Oracle Fusion to exchange data with external systems.

---

## Why Objects Are Important

Objects are important because they:
- Store business data
- Drive UI behavior
- Control automation and validations
- Enforce security
- Enable integrations

Almost every feature in Sales and Service Cloud depends on objects.

---

## Summary

The Objects module in Application Composer is used to:

- Define standard and custom objects
- Store and manage business data
- Create relationships and rollup fields
- Apply validations, triggers, and functions
- Enable integrations using web services

Understanding objects is essential before learning advanced topics such as workflows, security, and integrations.
