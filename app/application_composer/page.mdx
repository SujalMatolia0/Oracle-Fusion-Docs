# Application Composer

Application Composer is a configuration tool in **Oracle Fusion Sales & Service Cloud** used to **extend and customize CRM applications** in a controlled and upgrade-safe way.

It allows administrators and developers to configure business behavior **without writing heavy backend code**.

<Callout type="info">
All changes are stored as **metadata**, not source code, ensuring upgrade-safe customizations.
</Callout>

## What is Application Composer?

Application Composer is the centralized customization hub for Oracle Fusion applications.

### Core Capabilities

- Configure **standard business objects**
- Create **custom objects**
- Define **relationships** between objects
- Add **business logic** using rules and Groovy
- Control **security and roles**
- Configure **integrations**

---

## Main Modules in Application Composer

Application Composer is divided into functional areas, each serving a specific customization purpose.

### Objects

Define and manage business entities that store your data.

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Standard Objects | Pre-built Oracle objects | Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities |
| Custom Objects | User-created entities | Customer Feedback, Project Tracker |
| Fields | Data attributes | Email, Phone Number, Status |
| Layouts | UI page configuration | Form layouts, field visibility |

### Relationships

Connect objects together to model business relationships.

| Relationship Type | Use Case |
|-------------------|----------|
| One-to-Many | One Account → Many Contacts |
| Many-to-One | Many Opportunities → One Account |
| Lookup | Link related records |

### Object Workflows

Automate business logic without custom code.

- Field-level validations
- Auto-population of fields
- Conditional logic
- Triggers on create/update/delete

</Callout>

### Global Functions

Reusable Groovy logic that can be called from anywhere in the application.

```groovy
// Example: Global function to calculate discount
def calculateDiscount(amount, percentage) {
    return amount * (percentage / 100)
}
```

Benefits:
- Write once, use everywhere
- Promotes code reusability
- Easier maintenance

### Security

Control data access through role and privilege management.

| Security Layer | Controls |
|----------------|----------|
| Object Security | Who can access which objects |
| Field Security | Field-level read/write permissions |
| Role-Based Access | User role assignments |
| Record-Level Security | Which records users can see |

### Web Services

Integration endpoints for external systems.

- Expose custom objects via REST/SOAP APIs
- Define web service operations
- Configure authentication
- Map data fields

## What Application Composer Is NOT Used For

<Callout type="warning">
Application Composer has intentional boundaries to maintain system stability and upgrade safety.
</Callout>

Application Composer is **not** used to:

| Not Supported | Alternative Approach |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Build full standalone applications | Use Oracle APEX or external platforms |
| Modify Oracle-delivered database tables | Use custom objects instead |
| Write unrestricted backend code | Use controlled Groovy scripting |
| Direct database access | Use REST/SOAP APIs |
| Complex batch processing | Use Oracle Integration Cloud |

---

## Getting Started

To access Application Composer:

1. Navigate to **Setup and Maintenance → Application Composer**
2. Select the appropriate module based on your customization needs
3. Configure using the visual interface or add Groovy scripts if needed
4. Test thoroughly in a sandbox environment
5. Export configurations and deploy to production

<Callout>
**Best Practice**: Always document your customizations and maintain a change log.
</Callout>
