# Overview

Oracle Fusion Sales and Service Cloud is part of **Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications**, a suite of enterprise-grade cloud business software used by organizations to manage customer relationships, sales processes, and customer support operations.

This documentation provides a **conceptual overview** of the platform, its components, and customization capabilities.

## What is Oracle Fusion Cloud (OFC)?

**Oracle Fusion Cloud (OFC)** is an **online (cloud-based) enterprise platform** that helps organizations manage their core business processes.

### Key Purpose

Oracle Fusion Cloud is used to:

* Interact with customers
* Sell products and services
* Solve customer problems
* Automate and track business workflows

It is accessible through a **web browser** and does not require local installation.

## Oracle Fusion Sales & Service Cloud

Oracle Fusion Sales & Service Cloud focuses on **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** and is divided into two major modules:

1. **Sales Cloud**
2. **Service Cloud**

Each module is designed to support a specific phase of the customer lifecycle.

* Manage leads and prospects
* Track customer accounts
* Monitor sales pipelines
* Close deals efficiently

It is primarily used by **sales teams**.

### Core Objectives

* Increase sales productivity
* Improve pipeline visibility
* Track customer interactions
* Forecast revenue

### Key Objects in Sales Cloud

In Oracle Fusion, data is stored in **Objects** (similar to database tables).

| Object            | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Leads**         | Potential customers or sales prospects          |
| **Accounts**      | Companies or organizations you do business with |
| **Contacts**      | People associated with an account               |
| **Opportunities** | Potential sales deals                           |
| **Activities**    | Tasks, calls, meetings, and follow-ups          |

---

### Object Architecture (Conceptual)

Each object consists of:

* **Tables** → Store data
* **UI (Pages)** → Display and edit data
* **Business Logic** → Controls validations, rules, and automation

---

## Service Cloud

### What is Service Cloud?

**Service Cloud** helps organizations:

* Handle customer issues
* Track service requests
* Provide post-sales support

It is primarily used by **support and service teams**.

### Core Objectives

* Improve customer satisfaction
* Resolve issues efficiently
* Enforce service-level agreements (SLAs)
* Maintain service history

### Key Objects & Features in Service Cloud

| Feature / Object               | Description                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Service Requests (Tickets)** | Customer issues or complaints              |
| **Case Management**            | End-to-end handling of customer cases      |
| **Knowledge Base**             | Articles and solutions for common problems |
| **SLA Tracking**               | Tracks response and resolution times       |
| **Service Reports**            | Analytics and performance reports          |

---

## Objects in Oracle Fusion

### What is an Object?

An **Object** in Oracle Fusion is similar to:

* A **Table** in a database
* A **Business Entity** in an application

Objects store structured business data and are the backbone of Sales and Service Cloud.

### Object Components

* Fields (Columns)
* Records (Rows)
* UI Pages
* Business Rules
* Security Rules

---

## Customization Using Groovy Script

### What is Groovy Script?

**Groovy Script** is used in Oracle Fusion to write **small pieces of business logic** for customization.

It allows you to:

* Validate data
* Automate actions
* Control object behavior

Groovy scripts run **inside Oracle Fusion Cloud**.

---

### Where Groovy Script is Used

| Level               | Purpose     |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Field → Object**  | Validations |
| **Field → Object**  | Triggers    |
| **Object → Global** | Functions   |

---

### Examples of Usage

* Prevent saving invalid data
* Auto-populate fields
* Restrict updates based on conditions
* Perform calculations

---

## Configuration vs Customization

Oracle Fusion supports **low-code configuration** and **script-based customization**.

### Configuration (UI-based)

* Page Composer
* Security setup
* Object configuration
* Field visibility
* Layout changes

### Customization (Code-based)

* Groovy scripts
* Object rules
* Validation logic
* API integrations

> Both are used together to tailor the application to business needs.

## Common Terminology Mapping

| Traditional Term | Oracle Fusion Term    |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Table            | Object                |
| Column           | Field                 |
| Row              | Record                |

| Admin Panel      | Setup & Configuration |
| Business Rules   | Object Rules          |
