## Objects in Oracle Fusion

An **Object** is a place where business data is stored.

You can think of it as:
- A table in a database
- A business entity in the application

Objects store data such as customers, orders, or service requests.

### Object Components

Each object can include:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fields** | Data values |
| **Records** | Rows of data |
| **Pages** | UI screens |
| **Business Rules** | Validation and automation logic |
| **Security Settings** | Access control |

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Object customization requires proper understanding of data relationships and business processes.
</Callout>

**Configuration**: [Configure Objects in Application Composer →](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/applications-common/25d/oacex/objects.html)
</Callout>

---

## Customization Using Groovy Script

Oracle Fusion allows limited scripting using **Groovy**.

Groovy is used to add **business logic**, not to build full applications.

### What can Groovy do?

- ✅ Validate data
- ✅ Auto-update fields
- ✅ Control behavior during save or update
- ✅ Perform calculations

<Callout type="warning">
Groovy always runs **inside Oracle Fusion** and has limited scope. It cannot be used for external integrations.
</Callout>

### Where Groovy is Used

| Area | Purpose | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Field level** | Validation | Check if email format is correct |
| **Object level** | Triggers | Auto-populate fields on record creation |
| **Global level** | Reusable functions | Shared calculation logic |

---

## Configuration vs Customization

Oracle Fusion supports two approaches:

### Configuration
- ✅ Done using UI tools
- ✅ No code required
- ✅ Used for layouts, security, fields

### Customization
- 🔧 Uses Groovy scripts
- 🔧 Used for rules and automation
- ⚠️ Controlled and limited by Oracle

## APIs and Integrations

Oracle Fusion provides **built-in APIs** to connect with other systems.

These APIs allow:

| Capability | API Type | Use Case |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Reading data** | REST/SOAP | Fetch customer records |
| **Updating data** | REST/SOAP | Update order status |
| **Integrating** | REST/SOAP | Connect with external CRM |
