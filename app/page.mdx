## Objects in Oracle Fusion

An **Object** is a place where business data is stored.

You can think of it as:
- A table in a database
- A business entity in the application

Objects store data such as customers, orders, or service requests.

### Object parts

Each object can include:
- Fields (data values)
- Records (rows of data)
- Pages (UI screens)
- Business rules
- Security settings

## Customization Using Groovy Script

Oracle Fusion allows limited scripting using **Groovy**.

Groovy is used to add **business logic**, not to build full applications.

### What can Groovy do?

- Validate data
- Auto-update fields
- Control behavior during save or update
- Perform calculations

Groovy always runs **inside Oracle Fusion**.

### Where Groovy is used

| Area | Purpose |
|----|----|
| Field level | Validation |
| Object level | Triggers |
| Global level | Reusable functions |

## Configuration vs Customization

Oracle Fusion supports two approaches:

### Configuration
- Done using UI tools
- No code required
- Used for layouts, security, fields

### Customization

- Used for rules and automation
- Controlled and limited by Oracle
